# DirectScript
DirectScript is a programming language that's designed to be FEP or easy, fast, and portable. That's why we made it so that it compiles to Javascript, with an easier syntax. It's also open source, under the Apache License 2.0. It can be used in Javascript Libraries like React, or Angular, and it can be very good for making 2D games, or 3D (thanks to three.js). One of it's best features is that it's compatible with the MERN or MEAN stacks. It's compiler is made in Ruby
